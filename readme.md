**Project Overview: Enhancing Road Safety with AI-Driven Traffic Accident Analysis and Prediction**

1.This project aims to improve road safety by predicting traffic accidents using machine learning techniques.

2.It analyzes historical accident data along with traffic, weather, and temporal features.

3.The model identifies patterns and conditions likely to cause road accidents.

4.XGBoost, a robust ML algorithm, is used for building the prediction model.

5.The system can forecast accident risks in specific areas or times.

6.Real-time data integration allows for live monitoring and alerts.

7.The model is deployed via a web API for easy access by traffic authorities.

8.Residual plots and metrics like accuracy and RMSE help evaluate model performance.

9.The system supports dynamic traffic control and emergency response planning.

10.Future expansion includes edge deployment, app integration, and smart city use cases.
